/*                                                                   Question 
TOPIC IS — INTERFACE
A library needs to develop an online application for two types of users/roles: adults and children. Both of these users should be able to register an account.
Any user who is less than 12 years of age will be registered as a child, and they can borrow a “Kids” category book for 10 days, whereas an adult can borrow “Fiction” category books, which need to be returned within 7 days. Note: In future, more users/roles might be added to the library where similar rules will be enforced. Develop Interfaces and classes for the categories mentioned above.

1. Create an interface LibraryUser with the following methods declared,
Method Name
   registerAccount
   requestBook

2. Create 2 classes “KidUsers” and “AdultUser”, which implements the LibraryUser interface.

3. Both classes should have two instance variables as specified below.
         Instance variables Data type
            age int
            bookType String


4. The methods in the KidUser class should perform the following logic.
       registerAccount function:
If age < 12, a message displaying “You have successfully registered under a Kids Account” should be displayed in the console.
If(age>12), a message displaying “Sorry, Age must be less than 12 to register as a kid” should be displayed in the console.

      requestBook function:
If bookType is “Kids”, a message displaying “Book Issued successfully, please return the book within 10 days” should be displayed in the console.
Otherwise, a message displaying, “Oops, you are allowed to take only kids books” should be displayed in the console.


5. The methods in the AdultUser class should perform the following logic.
      registerAccount function:
If age > 12, a message displaying “You have successfully registered under an Adult Account” should be displayed in the console.
If age<12, a message displaying, “Sorry, Age must be greater than 12 to register as an adult” should be displayed in the console.
     
		 requestBook function:
If bookType is “Fiction”, a message displaying “Book Issued successfully, please return the book within 7 days” should be displayed in the console.
Else, a message displaying, “Oops, you are allowed to take only adult Fiction books” should be displayed in the console.


6. Create a class “LibraryInterfaceDemo.java” with a main method that performs the below functions,

Test case #1:
Create an instance of the KidUser class.
Set the age as specified in the table below, and invoke the registerAccount method of the KidUser object
Age
10
18
Set the book Type as specified in the table below and invoke the requestBook method of the KidUser object,
BookType
“Kids”
“Fiction”


Test case #2:
Create an instance of the AdultUser class.
Set the age as specified in the table below, and invoke the registerAccount method of the AdultUser object
Age
5
23
Set the book Type as specified in the table below and invoke the requestBook method of the AdultUser object
BookType
“Kids”
“Fiction”
*/


//Solution


interface LibraryUser {
    void registerAccount();
    void requestBook();
}
class KidUsers implements LibraryUser {

    int age;
    String bookType;
    public void registerAccount() {
        if (age < 12) {
            System.out.println("You have successfully registered under a Kids Account");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Sorry, Age must be less than 12 to register as a kid");
        }
    }

    public void requestBook() {
        if ("Kids".equals(bookType)) {
            System.out.println("Book Issued successfully, please return the book within 10 days");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Oops, you are allowed to take only kids books");
        }
    }
}

class AdultUser implements LibraryUser {

    int age;
    String bookType;

   
    public void registerAccount() {
        if (age > 12) {
            System.out.println("You have successfully registered under an Adult Account");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Sorry, Age must be greater than 12 to register as an adult");
        }
    }

   
    public void requestBook() {
        if ("Fiction".equals(bookType)) {
            System.out.println("Book Issued successfully, please return the book within 7 days");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Oops, you are allowed to take only adult Fiction books");
        }
    }
}

public class LibraryInterfaceDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        KidUsers kid = new KidUsers();
        kid.age = 10;
        kid.registerAccount();
        kid.bookType = "Kids";
        kid.requestBook();
        kid.bookType = "Fiction";
        kid.requestBook();
        kid.age = 18;
        kid.registerAccount();


        System.out.println("\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n");

        AdultUser adult = new AdultUser();

        adult.age = 5;
        adult.registerAccount();
        adult.bookType = "Kids";
        adult.requestBook();
        adult.age = 23;
        adult.registerAccount();
        adult.bookType = "Fiction";
        adult.requestBook();
    }
}

//OUTPUT

You have successfully registered under a Kids Account
Book Issued successfully, please return the book within 10 days
Oops, you are allowed to take only kids books
Sorry, Age must be less than 12 to register as a kid

------------------------------------------------------------------

Sorry, Age must be greater than 12 to register as an adult
Oops, you are allowed to take only adult Fiction books
You have successfully registered under an Adult Account
Book Issued successfully, please return the book within 7 days
